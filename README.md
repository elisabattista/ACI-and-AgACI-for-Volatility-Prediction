# ACI-and-AgACI-for-Volatility-Prediction
This project implements and compares two conformal prediction frameworks — Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and Aggregated Adaptive Conformal Inference (AgACI) — applied to financial time series volatility forecasting. Using real financial asset data, we explore uncertainty quantification through prediction intervals generated by different conformal methods combined with GARCH models.
Project overview
Part I: Implementation of ACI on volatility prediction with GARCH(1,1) and a more advanced GARCH variant, comparing standard CP and adaptive CP strategies with various score normalizations.
Part II: Extension with AgACI, an adaptive parameter-free aggregation method over multiple ACI experts with different adaptation rates, applied to volatility uncertainty quantification.
Evaluation focuses on coverage rates over time and the impact of adaptation parameters.
